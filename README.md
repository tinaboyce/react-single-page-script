# React Single-page Application script
No configuration needed, code sooner! After running the setup.sh script, just run 'npm start' and it should work in the dev environment.

Sets of command that sets ensures node/npm is up-to-date and bootstraps with [Facebook Incubator - Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I do highly recommend reading [Facebook Incubator - Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to understand the limitations of Create React App as the feature set is intentionally limited. For me, this helps me set up a new learning environment quickly so I can improve on my React skills.
